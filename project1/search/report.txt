Question 7 comments:
	I found this question by far the most difficult.  I tried several different
	heuristics that were all not admissible.  The one I settled on was also
	not admissible until I added the cluster score aspect to it.  Even then,
	how to find the cluster score was difficult.
	My solution changes how far	to search for other food items (the cluster
	score) depending on how large the grid is.  Although the algorithm finds a
	good solution, it takes a lot of time/memory.
	I also feel like the dynamic changing of the cluster score (line 522-525)
	is a little bit 'hacky' and was arrived at mainly through trial and error.
	I would have liked to improve that given more time.
